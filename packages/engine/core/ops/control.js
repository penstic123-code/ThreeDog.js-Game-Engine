// engine.control: who decides where a character goes. Every character has one control slot (by its id); one owner is in charge at a time.
//   const h = engine.control.take(npc, { owner: 'escort', layer: 'script', step: (dt, ch) => ({ x: 1, z: 0 }) });   // the engine calls step
//   const m = engine.control.take(player, { owner: 'roll', layer: 'script' }); engine.onFixed(dt => m.move(1, 0, false, dt));   // or you move
//   h.remove();                      // give it back: the owner below carries on where it paused
//   ctx.control.take(ch, { ... })    // inside a module: owner defaults to the module, and the hold goes when the module goes
// Why one slot and not "everyone calls character.move": keys, walkTo, an NPC behaviour, a cutscene and the network all used to push the same
// character in the same step; the last move() won and nobody could tell why the player slid. Now exactly one owner moves it per step.
// Rules (one table, so a tool can predict them):
//   - layers, lowest first: base (the character's own driver: the player's keys, an NPC's behaviour) < script (walkTo, a quest escort, an AI
//     order) < cutscene (timeline) < physics (a ragdoll: nothing can steer a limp body, a cutscene included) < net (a character another machine
//     drives: held for good, nobody else may take it)
//   - the highest layer is in charge; the ones below are paused, not cancelled: when it ends they carry on (a walk resumes after a cutscene)
//   - one owner per layer: a second, different owner on the same layer throws control-conflict naming both, in every build, and the first keeps
//     the character. The same owner taking again replaces its own hold.
//   - a character with any holder moves only through its holder: the step function, or the handle's move(). A direct character.move() from
//     anyone else throws control-bypass in dev. A character nobody holds (a hand-built Character in a test) moves freely.
//   - "who decides where to go" (this) is not "how the body moves" (character.mover: simple / rapier / manual); the two never mix.
//   - a hold given task(why) is a task: it runs until something in TASK_ENDS happens to the ground under it. Pausing below a higher holder does not end it.
// Kept by id, not by model: an NPC's model is torn down and rebuilt as it goes far and near; the hold stays with the NPC. The slot is dropped when
// the world record goes (world:remove) or a record-less character is disposed. Not saved: holders are code (a running walk, a cutscene), retaken
// by that code after a load.
