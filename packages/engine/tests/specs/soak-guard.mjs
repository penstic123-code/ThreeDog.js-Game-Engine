// [guard] Short soak (outside review: "nothing has run for more than minutes"). One self-playing game on the stress-field page: every round streams terrain and city
// blocks in and out, spawns and removes records, runs a quest and a dialogue, switches weather and the day, saves and loads, starts a new game and changes scene;
// every few rounds the whole engine is disposed and created again. After warm-up the engine's own counts must be the same every round, and a new engine must start
// with the same counts as the one before. The long version (30+ minutes real time on real WebGPU, and simulated days) is a release-time command:
//   node packages/engine/tests/stress-field/run.mjs soak '{"minutes":30}'     (docs/plans/release-checklist.md)
// Run: npm test -- Soak
