// The seat: one relation { rider, vehicle, id, seat } between a character and anything with the vehicle contract. Owned here, so it holds whoever the control slot's holder is:
// a holder only says what the driver wants. The rider's world record keeps the vehicle id and the seat, written when the relation changes and read back on a load.
// Vehicles are found through one registry, not through the module that built them: rigid joins its cars, a game joins its own (characters.addVehicle), and enter joins whatever has an id.
// Why a vehicle that joins answers the records: a car built after the load is the same case as a car built before it, so the rider sits and the record never lies.
// Per engine, like the supports (movers/support.js): a hand-built Character has a seat with no module around it.
