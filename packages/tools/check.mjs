// Rule check: npm run check
// Runs the rules in packages/tools/rules/R*.mjs one by one (each described at the top of its file, with its criteria and allowlist), output
//   grouped by rule: errors (✗) must be fixed; warnings (!) need a picture and can always be cleared (fixed, or confirmed the way the rule says).
//   The engine's hard rules are rules like the rest: R27 core imports or names no module, R14 no material made directly in engine code,
//   R15 no hard-coded Chinese text, R39 neutral fallback colors, R46 no import of another module's internal file, R3 every module has a
//   display name. Then the generator checks (types, content, generated docs up to date) run in parallel.
// In a game installed from npm (paths.mjs MODE 'game') only the game-side checks run: the rules marked game: true (doc references, doc sizes,
//   file sizes), GAMEMAP up to date, content validation and types. The engine's own checks run in the monorepo.
//   npm run check -- --rule R4,R8   run only these rules (R04 / r4 work too, and so does --rule R4 --rule R8; the generator checks below are skipped; an id that names no rule
//                                   is an error that lists them all)
//   npm run check                   errors in full, warnings as one count line per rule
//   npm run check -- --verbose      list the warnings (the first 15 per rule) and extra rule info (for example which checkOptions R6 skipped)
//   npm run check -- --all          list every warning
//   npm run check -- --json         the same run as one JSON result on stdout (lib/result.mjs: { ok, summary, items }); the text goes to stderr
//   npm run check -- -w <game>      scoped to one game (also when run from inside a game folder): only its problems are printed and set the exit
//                                   code; other games and the engine are one count line each
