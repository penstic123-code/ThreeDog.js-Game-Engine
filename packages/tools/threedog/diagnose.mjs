// Why the bridge cannot be used: one of five causes, each with the single most likely next step (no generic checklist).
//   no-server   nothing is listening (no dev.json, or the process in it is gone)           -> threedog play
//   starting    the server answers but the page has no ready engine yet and logged nothing -> wait, then threedog status
//   page-error  the page's script failed (errors in .threedog/errors.log) or start() blocked -> threedog errors latest
//   busy        the server's process is alive but the port did not answer the ping in time    -> wait, retry (never start a second server)
//   no-bridge   a dev server answers, but it has no dev bridge (its vite config lacks the plugin) -> use gameConfig
